                  <div class="collapsible-header">How is DiversaTech different from other consulting club on campus?</div>
                  <div class="collapsible-body">
                      <p>We Think Differently. Each of our consulting teams is comprised of individuals from various disciplines across campus from humanities to STEM to bring an interdisciplinary approach to solving challenging industry problems. As much of today’s workforce, especially in tech, relies on cross team collaboration in order to successfully execute and launch a product, we feel it is important to emulate this interdisciplinary structure so the various perspectives on how to tackle a problem are brought to the table. While other consulting organizations are composed of mostly business/economics majors, we seek to channel the many ways Cal prepares students across different majors to analyze and solve problems that are otherwise largely ignored. </p>
                      <p>We are Tech Consultants. As a group of top students with such diverse skillsets, we are able to go beyond traditional strategy consulting and provide our clients with recommendations on user experience/design, product marketing, software recommendations, market research, and much more. The fusion of individuals who worked as software engineering interns at some of today’s leading tech companies with those who have been finalists in international product development competitions allows us to form teams of individuals fluent in the whole product lifecycle. All in all, our recommendations optimize products to achieve business goals while meeting user needs and maximizing return on investment.</p>
                      <p>We are Inclusive. A central aspect of DiversaTech’s mission is to build an inclusive community in order to foster collaboration and develop consulting skills throughout campus. Instead of rejecting applicants who do not fully meet the qualifications to be tech consultants, we have developed an educational branch of our organization that exposes students to a foundation of consulting practices and current trends in technology. We see this as a development pipeline that gives students an opportunity to apply the creative and analytical skills they learn in the classroom to real world problems. In doing this, we hope to prepare more individuals to work on our consulting projects in the future and see this as the best way to pay our skills forward.</p>

                  <div class="collapsible-header">I’m interested in consulting, but as a freshman, I have no experience.  Is this club interested in freshmen?</div>
                  <div class="collapsible-body"><p>DiversaTech is open to all majors and all backgrounds, including all grade levels (freshmen to seniors). We encourage you to apply! If you do not make it into a consulting team, there are other opportunities like our educational branch to help you gain the skill sets to become a consultant.</p></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <div class="collapsible-header">I am really interested in the consulting club and I will definitely apply for the membership. However, I won’t be able to make it to all the meetings. Is that okay?</div>
                  <div class="collapsible-body"><p>In order to be considered for a consulting team you have to be able to attend all mandatory events. As for info sessions, you just have to attend one. As far as time commitments, meeting times for each consulting time will be different to fit the team's schedule. Also, keep in mind, we have bi-weekly general meetings for all club members.</p></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <div class="collapsible-header">What type of resume are you looking for?</div>
                  <div class="collapsible-body"><p>There is no ideal resume! If not your resume helps us better understand your skills,  knowledge, and abilities (KSAs) that are relevant to being a consultant and a team member. So make sure that your resume exemplifies those leadership, team player, and initiative qualities.</p></div>
